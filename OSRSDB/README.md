ALEX JONES DAT 405 ASSIGNMENT 2

In this assignment I decided to use the API of a 2007 MMORPG called Runescape, which has a stock market like exchange system called the "Grand exchange", in which players can trade items with eachother for in-game gold called "GP". I was able to find an API that let me use the data from said exchange. I decided to pick 2 categories of two of the most traded items: ores and runes, which are used in the game to create armour and cast spells. I manually searched the JSON file created by the API and got the ID numbers of each of the items that I wanted to display. I stored them in an array called oID. I then created several different ways of displaying the data; in graph form, in list form and in a visualise form, in which the canvas would be filled with several copies of the item, creating a generative art work.
